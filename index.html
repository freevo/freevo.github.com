	<h1 class="content_heading">About Freevo</h1>
	<p>
	Freevo is an open source HTPC media centre. It integrates PVR / DVR functionality along with music, video, gaming, 
	home automation and more. It is written in python and uses existing popular software such as mplayer,
	xine, vlc and skype. Freevo also provides access to popular services such as YouTube, Flickr, Apple trailers, 
	IMDB, Hulu Desktop and more through integrated plugins. 
	<p>
	Primarily aimed at the Linux platform it is also possible to run on OSX and for the determined on Windows. 
	It can be controlled via keyboard and mouse, IR remote, network app or through it's web interface (Android 
	and IOS apps are planned). Freevo can record and display TV from multiple sources (analogue, 
	DVB-C/T/S, set top box via composite with IR blaster). You can pause or rewind live TV and schedule recordings
	via the on screen EPG or remotely via a web interface.

        <h1 class="content_heading">Update: Freevo.org shutting down</h1>
	<p>
          Now 6 years later, Freevo is more or less dead. Kodi is so much more
          powerfull and Python 2.x is end-of-support. Therefore, I will not renew the 
          freevo.org domain. I will update the code on github with my current mail
          address and copy the homepage to sf.net and github.
	</p>
        <p>
          I still use some parts of the code and maybe, one day, some parts my
          get a new life. As for me, I hope to update kaa.metadata to Python 3.x
          and create a thetvdb library out of kaa.webmetadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good Bye and thanks to all people involved in the project

        <h1 class="content_heading">Freevo in a dormant state</h1>
	<p>
	  I failed to get a release of Freevo 2 out. I changed too
	  much, a complete rewrite and some parts are also written
	  three or four times. My fault, I know -- an error made years
	  ago and when noticed, it was too late to change it. And
	  since I started a new job four years ago my time working on
	  Freevo got smaller and smaller every month. Jason also is
	  completely busy with his job.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I still say Freevo 2 is ready to use, but I will not release
	  it. I'm not sure it works with the latest clutter or
	  gstreamer, I only know it works for me. It lacks many
	  important features such as DVD playback (I have a BluRay
	  Player) and TV recording. I do not need it and I don't have
	  time to code it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Besides that, XBMC has a much bigger community, UPnP is enough for many
	  people (even I use NAS plus BubbleUPnP plus TV sometimes) and new development
	  such as Chromecast will reduce Freevo's usefulness even further.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I will continue to use Freevo 2, I may even write an Android
	  client for it (after learning Python with Freevo which was
	  useful for getting my current job, hacking Android is a good
	  next step), but I see no real future for Freevo without a
	  live community and more people hacking code.  If someone
	  contributes something, I will add it. If someone needs help
	  to get Freevo 2 running, I will provide it.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Since we also lack someone maintaining the server we host
	  and I do not want to pay for something we don't need, I shut
	  it down. This means the SVN and the Wiki will be gone. The
	  code is already on github and will remain there. A static
	  backup of the 1.x Wiki is linked here; the 2.0 WiKi is more
	  outdated and wrong than correct and therefore, it is not
	  visible here. The mailing list on SF will continue and so
	  will the mail server hosting freevo.org and all mail
	  addresses will continue to be valid.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Maybe after some time someone resurrects Freevo. I would
	  love to pass the maintainership over to someone just as I
	  took it over from Krister years ago. Maybe someone takes the
	  kaa-stuff and writes something new and better. I'm happy to
	  assist and I think the same is true for Jason.  Maybe I will
	  release something someday based on the current code.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It was a great time, I learned a lot and it was much fun.
	</p>
